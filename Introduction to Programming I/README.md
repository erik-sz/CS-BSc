### Introduction to Programming I - JavaScript, P5.js

This module is focused on basic programming techniques. By taking this module, we have learned how to use the basic elements of a computer programming such as variables, conditionals, functions and loops. We have also learned how to create interactive, graphical computer programs. We have been introduced to basic object oriented programming techniques.

#### Topics covered: 
* Our development environment 
* Drawing in 2D 
* Variables, Objects and Interaction 
* Conditional Statements 
* Basic loops and arrays 
* Traversing with for loops 
* Functions 
* Advanced loops and arrays 
* Extending Objects 
* Constructor functions

#### Code description
This application is a simple demonstration of a basic game. In the game we can move the charachter left and right with the arrow buttons, can jump with the space button, we can collect diamonds and gain score from it. The charachter dies after plummeting to canyons and losts one life. The game world containes mountains, trees and clouds created with constructor functions.
