### Software Design and Development - C++, JavaScript, Python

This module aimed to advance our software development skills so that we can write more robust and complicated programs. We have learned how to use a range of programming techniques that will allow us to deal with unwanted or unexpected events that might happen when our program is running. We have used defensive coding to check data before processing it, and exception handling to gracefully manage unexpected or unwanted occurrences. We have learned how to discuss program structure in terms of cohesion (how to decide what does where) and coupling (how to define the interactions between different parts of the program). We have learned about test driven development, where we write tests for our code, and write the code itself, in parallel. 

#### Topics covered: 
* Language primer 1: variables and conditionals 
* Language primer 2: control flow
* Language primer 3: functions 
* Version Control 
* Collaboration using version control 
* Module coupling and cohesion 
* Unit Testing 
* Test driven development
* Defensive coding
* Exception handling

#### Code description
The code includes mainly some practicing and demonstration of unittestin with Python
