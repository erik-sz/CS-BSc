# Computer Science BSc

#### This repository containes various projects that we created throughout the Computer Science course at University of London.

Using HTML and CSS, we have learned how to mark up, lay out and style web content. We have learned about the document object model and how you can dynamically manipulate it with JavaScript to create interactive web pages. We have considered accessibility and usability issues, and how we can overcome them. We have learned about web site deployment and how you can use it to make our websites accessible to other people. Topics covered: • Introduction to Web Development • Web Site Design • Essential HTML • Introduction to CSS • Positioning in Styling & Design • Responsive CSS • Introduction to JavaScript for the Web • Manipulating the DOM using Javascript • JavaScript Libraries • Web Hosting & Professional Practices

### Algorithms and Data Structures I - Theory, Pseudocode

This module aims to get us to begin thinking about how to use computers to solve problems. We have developed skills in thinking algorithmically and learned the main concepts of algorithms and data structures. We have learned about linear data structures such as arrays, vectors and lists, and a unifying framework for considering such data structures as collections. We have learned how algorithms can be expressed as flowcharts and pseudocode, and how to convert these expressions into running programs. We have learned specific algorithms used for sorting and searching, and how to express repetition as iteration and recursion. Topics covered: • Introduction to algorithms, flowcharts and pseudocode • Computations using flowcharts and psuedocode • Pairs, vectors and dynamic arrays • Basic searching • Linked lists • Basic sorting • Advanced searching and introduction to complexity • Recursive algorithms • Advanced sorting • Linear collections

### Object Oriented Programming - C++

The aim of this module was to provide us an object oriented programming skill set. We have learned what objects and classes are and how to write our own classes. We have learned how objects can interact with each other, including defining and implementing interfaces to control the interaction. We have learned how to use inheritance to inherit and extend functionality from parent classes. We have learned how to write code according to style guidelines and how to write formal code documentation. Topics covered: • Variable and types • Control flow: conditionals and iteration • Functions • Objects and classes • Interaction between objects • Inheritance: extending a parent class • Inheritance: defining a class hierarchy • Code documentation and style • Abstraction and polymorphism: implementing an abstract class • Abstraction and polymorphism: defining an interface

### Software Design and Development - C++, JavaScript, Python

This module aimed to advance our software development skills so that we can write more robust and complicated programs. We have learned how to use a range of programming techniques that will allow us to deal with unwanted or unexpected events that might happen when our program is running. We have used defensive coding to check data before processing it, and exception handling to gracefully manage unexpected or unwanted occurrences. We have learned how to discuss program structure in terms of cohesion (how to decide what does where) and coupling (how to define the interactions between different parts of the program). We have learned about test driven development, where you write tests for your code, and write the code itself, in parallel. Topics covered: • Language primer 1: variables and conditionals • Language primer 2: control flow • Language primer 3: functions • Version Control • Collaboration using version control • Module coupling and cohesion • Unit Testing • Test driven development • Defensive coding • Exception handling

### Graphics Programming - JavaScript, P5.js

This module aimed to show us how to work with images in a variety of ways. We have learned how to synthesize graphics and how to process visual signals. We have learned about the mathematical ideas that underpin digital representations of graphics. We have learned how digital media files represent sound and graphics, and how to handle and manipulate them. You will learn the basics of working with simulated physics and 3D graphics. Topics covered: • Introduction: manipulating images • Images, pixels and colors • Image processing 1 • Image processing 2 • computer vision and images 1 • computer vision and images 2 • application of geometry tor animation • application of geometry to interaction • Simulaitng physical systems • Recap and review

### Databases, Networks and the Web - HTML, JavaScript, SQL, Express.js

In particular, we have learned about the Relational Model , Query processing, and socket architectures to enable communication. Topics covered: • Networking concepts • Building Simple socket clients and servers • Building an HTTP server • Generating web pages from data using templates • Relational Databases • Querying a database • Representing data in a database • Representing data in a database pt 2 • Revision of HTML and CSS • Building a dynamic website

### Programming with Data - Python

This module showed us how to work with data: getting data from a variety of sources, visualising data in compelling, informative ways, processing data to make it useful and shareable, and reasoning with data to test hypotheses and make parameterised predictions. The module has also introduced us to a new language and programming environment that is well-adapted to languages for these applications.
