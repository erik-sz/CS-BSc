### Graphics Programming - JavaScript, P5.js

This module aims to show you how to work with images in a variety of ways. We learned how to synthesize graphics and how to process visual signals. We learned about the mathematical ideas that underpin digital representations of graphics. We learned learn how digital media files represent sound and graphics, and how to handle and manipulate them. We learned learn the basics of working with simulated physics and 3D graphics. Topics covered: • Introduction: manipulating images • Images, pixels and colors • Image processing 1 • Image processing 2 • computer vision and images 1 • computer vision and images 2 • application of geometry tor animation • application of geometry to interaction • Simulaitng physical systems • Recap and review
