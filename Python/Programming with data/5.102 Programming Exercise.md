## This code is scraping "Den Of Geek" webpage, then parsed the main page to find any links with a certain class that seemed to identify the articles. Then, for each of these articles I searched the <main> tag, iterated through any <article> tags within, and printed out the text of any <p> tags inside the articles. From this I was able to extract the basic text of all the articles linked from the main page.
